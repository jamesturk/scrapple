      This site exists to demonstrate some basic scraping techniques, as well as provide examples of real world challenges that scraper authors often encounter.  It was primarily written to assist with examples and documentation for <a href="https://github.com/jamesturk/spatula">spatula</a> but feel free to use it for whatever you want.  Just be nice, the site is hosted on a free <a href="https://fly.io">fly.io</a> VM.
      </p>

      <p>While other sites with a similar purpose exist, they often omit some of the common complications that can arise in scraping.  The eventual goal of this site is to serve as a test suite of sorts for handling edge cases.
