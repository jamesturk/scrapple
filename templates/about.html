        This site is generated from data scraped from <a href="https://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/about-us/history-chicagos-parks">Chicago Park District</a>.  It is not meant to be authoritative and is not kept up to date.

        This site was originally created as a demo for <a href="https://github.com/jamesturk/spatula">spatula</a> and updated for CAPP 30122 at the University of Chicago.
      </p>

      <p>
      This site exists to demonstrate some basic scraping techniques, as well as provide examples of real world challenges that scraper authors often encounter. You may use it for this purpose however you see fit. Just be nice, the site is hosted on a free <a href="https://fly.io">fly.io</a> VM.
      </p>

      <p>While other sites with a similar purpose exist, they often omit some of the common complications that can arise in scraping.  The eventual goal of this site is to serve as a test suite of sorts for handling edge cases.
